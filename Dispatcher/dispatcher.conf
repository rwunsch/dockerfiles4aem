    # log level for the dispatcher log, can be either specified
    # as a string or an integer (in parentheses)

    # if turned on, request to / are not handled by the dispatcher
    # use the mod_alias then for the correct mapping
    DispatcherDeclineRoot Off
    
    # if turned on, the dispatcher uses the URL already processed 
    # by handlers preceeding the dispatcher (i.e. mod_rewrite) 
    # instead of the original one passed to the web server. 
    DispatcherUseProcessedURL On
    
    # if turned to 1, the dispatcher does not spool an error
    # response to the client (where the status code is greater
    # or equal than 400), but passes the status code to
    # Apache, which e.g. allows an ErrorDocument directive
    # to process such a status code. 
    #
    # Additionally, one can specify the status code ranges that should
    # be left to web server to handle, e.g.
    #
    # DispatcherPassError 400-404,501
    DispatcherPassError 0

    #
    # DispatcherKeepAliveTimeout specifies the number of seconds a
    # connection to a backend should be kept alive. If not set or
    # set to zero, connections are not kept alive.
